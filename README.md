# Event Management Dashboard
## Fest io
### **Executive Summary**
The proposed solution is a feature-rich, role-based Event Management Dashboard that streamlines event creation, management, and user interaction. Utilizing modern technologies such as Node.js, Express, PostgreSQL (NeonDB), and Next.js, the platform will provide a secure, responsive, and user-friendly experience. Role-based authentication ensures differentiated access for organizers and attendees. The inclusion of a notification system using Nodemailer ensures timely alerts for new events, upcoming deadlines, and registrations. This project employs a modular and scalable architecture, leveraging cutting-edge tools like Framer Motion, TanStack Query, and Shadcn, with TypeScript for robust code quality.

### **Technical Approach**
1. **Backend**:
   - **Node.js and Express** will power the API endpoints.
   - **Nodemailer** for sending email notifications with customizable templates.
   - **PostgreSQL (NeonDB)** for managing data securely and efficiently.
   - Middleware for authentication and validation using `jsonwebtoken` and `bcrypt`.

2. **Frontend**:
   - **Next.js** for server-side rendering and dynamic routing.
   - **Framer Motion** for smooth animations and transitions.
   - **React-Hook-Forms** for form management with built-in validation.
   - **TanStack Query** for handling real-time data fetching and caching.
   - **TailwindCSS and Shadcn** for building a consistent and attractive UI.

3. **Deployment**:
   - Host the backend on **Vercel** or **AWS** for scalability.
   - Deploy the database on **NeonDB** for high availability and performance.
   - Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipelines for seamless updates.

4. **Notification System**:
   - Automatically trigger email notifications when:
     - A new event is created.
     - A registration deadline approaches.
     - An event reminder is needed.
   - Use **Nodemailer** with SMTP or third-party services like SendGrid.

5. **Development Workflow**:
   - Follow Agile development practices.
   - Use **TypeScript** to ensure type safety and reduce runtime errors.
   - Integrate **version control** using GitHub.
